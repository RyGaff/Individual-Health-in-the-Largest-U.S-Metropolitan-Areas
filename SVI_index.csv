Puerto Rico is treated as urban because over 90% of the population lives in urban areas.

"Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/ Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program. CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index."

Note: The higher the index the more vulnerable the population is to the associated issues.

"The Social Vulnerability Index (0 Lowest to 1 Highest) is a place-based index derived from 16 U.S. census variables from the 5-year American Community Survey to identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. These variables are grouped into four themes (Socioeconomic status, Household characteristics, Racial and Ethnic Minority Status, Housing Type and Transportation) that cover four major areas of social vulnerability and then combined into a single measure of overall social vulnerability. For more information about how the index is derived, please reference the CDC SVI documentation. [ https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/documentation/SVI_documentation_2022.html ]"

"Note: This website still uses Connecticut counties instead of planning regions for consistency of geographies across data topics. If/when all data sources have new planning regions, then this website will switch to using them. 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes will be used for Connecticut counties."

Data for United States does not include Puerto Rico.
